# src/utils/config/nn_config.yaml

optimizer: adam
learning_rate: 0.001
hidden_layer_width: 64 # How many neurons in each layer
depth: 2 # How many layers
num_epochs: 50

#Purpose: Contains the configuration for the neural network, such as hyperparameters for training.

#Usage:
#- The configuration is read by data_analysis.py to adjust model training parameters (e.g., learning rate, batch size, number of epochs).

#Next Step: Modify the yaml file to experiment with different training configurations.
